Copy of a Letter from CHARLES GORDON of Ter- I746 perse 1 to his own lady.
DEAR HEART,—I now tell you that I suffer death to-morrow
for my duty to God, my king, and country. I bless God I
die in charity with all men. I think my butchered body will I4 Nov.
be taken care of and buried as a Christian, by order of Francis
Farquharson, who has acted a father to me, and laid out a
good deal of money to and for me, whereof you may expect a
particular account, which I leave you on my blessing to repay
him. I die with the greatest regret that I've been a bad
husband to you, and I beg you'll pardon me in your heart,
and that you 11 express your goodness (as you'll answer to God
and me in the everlasting world) by your care of and motherly fol. 426.
looking to your children's salvation and right putting them
to business in this world. I know not how many are alive;
only set the boys to some right imployment while young, and
strive to admonish the daughters in the fear of God. I herewith
send you a note of what I would have done with the trifles
I have a concern in, for you know the lump of my business.
My dearest,—If I should write till my life ends I would still
have something to say. But to stop that I end with my dying
blessing to you, my young ones, and your poor mother, if
alive. Your last from, your unfortunate husband,
CHA. GORDON.
Carlisle, November 14th, 1746.
1 He was ' Younger of Terpersie' in Aberdeenshire, and had engaged as a
volunteer. His father, James Gordon, was an officer in the Prince's army. In
the List of Persons concerned in the Rebellion, etc. (Scot. Hist. Soc., vol. viii.),
he is said to have been made prisoner at Carlisle. But a story is told of his
having been captured at his own house, when, after lurking long among the
neighbouring hills, he ventured to pass a night there. His captors, not being
sure of his identity, carried him before the minister of the parish, but not getting
satisfaction from him, they took him to a farmhouse where his wife and children
resided. On his approach his children ran out and greeted him with cries of
' Daddy ! Daddy !' and so unwittingly sealed their father's fate. He was tried
at Carlisle and executed there on I5th November I746. As the prisoners taken
at Carlisle were sent to London, and those taken in Scotland to Carlisle, the
story may be authentic.""","[""Mitforde, William""]",

A fine letter from Pembroke to the deputy lieutenants of Cornwall: Pembroke had been Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall since 1604, and here he addresses his deputies about Pendennis Castle (near Falmouth). Among his correspondents is Richard Carew - almost certainly the antiquary Richard Carew of Antony (1555-1620), author of the Survey of Cornwall, or his son Sir Richard (1680-1643). Pembroke is well known as a candidate for the dedicatee of Shakespeare s Sonnets (1609); he was of course also the co-dedicatee of the First Folio, and clearly knew and patronised Shakespeare. This document is signed less than three months after Shakespeare s death, which occurred on 23 April 1616.",[],

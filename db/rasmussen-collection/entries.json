The play was performed at the Comédie-Française in 1856, and the manuscript may date from that time. The page is an excerpt of a conversation between Jacques and Celia in act II, scene VII. Sand made several changes to Shakespeare's work, most notably her creation of a romantic connection between Celia and Jacques rather than adhering to the original Celia and Oliver pairing. In her preface, Sand remarks that the changes she made were in an attempt to fit the fashion of the time. Lightly toned, darker around edges and at mail folds. Light foxing, some ink transfer.",

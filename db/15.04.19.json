His captors, not being\nsure of his identity, carried him before the minister of the parish, but not getting\nsatisfaction from him, they took him to a farmhouse where his wife and children\nresided. On his approach his children ran out and greeted him with cries of\n' Daddy ! Daddy !' and so unwittingly sealed their father's fate.

Collation: A–Q4 (lacking A1, blank except for signature);.\n\nHeadlines partly shaved throughout, otherwise a large copy with text and sidenotes intact.\n\nFrom Arthur Freeman: \n\"Although in 1601 Sir Francis Bacon, aged forty, was an experienced and facile writer – of texts \nranging from ‘devices’ or dramatic dialogues designed for private performance to legal opin-\nions, socio-political tracts, and the earlier of his immortalizing ‘essays or counsels civill and \nmorall’ – A Declaration of the Practises and Treasons is only his second or third publication in \nprint, following the brief initial selection of Essayes [and] Religious Meditations (1597) and the \nattributed Letter Written out of England to an English Gentleman Remaining at Padua (1599), \non the pathetic and clumsy assassination conspiracy of Edward Squire. A Declaration, while \nquasi-official in its stance and auspices, proved controversial indeed, since throughout the \nprevious decade Essex had been a close friend and patron of Bacon, forwarding his credit at \ncourt and (while he could) with the hitherto unsympathetic Queen. But on 8 February 1601 \n– after his failure to suppress the campaign of the Irish rebels under Tyrone, and frustrated at \nhis reduced political status – Essex led his own ‘forlorn’ rebellion against his sovereign: Bacon \nwas compelled to choose between personal and national loyalty, and he turned state’s evidence \nwith a vengeance, testifying and actively promoting the prosecution at the trial of Essex and \nhis immediate followers, and at the Queen’s behest composing A Declaration, for which he \nreceived a reward of £1200, out of the sizeable fines levied on some of Bacon’s adherents. Essex \nhimself, during the trial, accused Bacon of being ‘an accomplice’, by virtue of his having served \nat one time as his amanuensis, but Bacon successfully insisted he had ‘spent more time in vain \nin studying how to make the Earl a good servant to the Queen, than I have done in anything else’. Yet in 1604 he still felt uneasy enough to publish his Apologie in Certaine Imputations Concerning the late Earle of Essex, in which he somewhat petulantly defends himself further from charges of complicity and/or ingratitude.\n \n\nBacon’s own text (A3–K3) on Essex and the particulars of the abortive insurrection is \nfollowed (K4–Q4) by the ‘voluntary confessions’ of his fourteen supposed closest allies and \nfive others, taken before and during the trial and concluding with two (dated 21 and 25 Feb-\nruary) by Essex himself, who was convicted and quickly executed in the Tower on the 25th. \nBut for many readers the most provocative detail falls at the end of the first part (K2v–K3r), \nwhere Bacon gives a vivid account of a kind of ‘rally’ arranged by the would-be rebels on the \neve of their fruitless march on the City. Sir Gelly Meyrick visited the Globe Theatre with a \nparty of conspirators and negotiated with Augustine Phillips of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, \nShakespeare’s own acting company, to perform the suggestive tragedy of Richard ii, ‘the Play \nof deposing King Richard the second’, on that Saturday, when members of Essex’s inner circle \nattended, hoping to inspire support from the citizenry for the next day’s campaign. The rel-\nevant substance of Shakespeare’s play was of course the overthrow and subsequent death of \na weak monarch, ousted by the vigorous usurper Henry iv (Bolingbroke), and the voluntary \nabdication of the former – in a famous scene (iv.i.154–315) played onstage as early as 1597, but \nwithheld from print until the fourth quarto of 1608. Phillips objected, like the company man he \nwas, that ‘the Play was olde, and they should have losse in playing it, because fewe would come \nto it’, but was appeased by a promised subsidy of ‘fourty shillings extraordinarie given to play \nit, and so thereupon playd it was’. ‘Neither was it casuall’, Bacon adds, ‘but a Play bespoken by \nMerrick’, although Phillips later alleged that the applicants were Sir Charles Percy, Sir Jocelyn \nPercy, and Lord Mounteagle, ‘with some thre[e] more’ (Shakspere Allusion-Book (1932), i:82, \noddly omitting Bacon’s text).\"","binding":"Polished calf \ngilt by Baynton; top hinge rubbed, with short split at foot, but sound.","cost":3783.68,"acquired":{"$date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"},"source":"Arthur Freeman Rare Books and Manuscripts","appraisalValue":0,"titleTranscription":" A Declaration of the Practises \u0026 Treasons attempted and committed by Robert late Earle of Essex and his Complices, against her Majestie and her Kingdoms, and of the proceedings as well at the Arraignments \u0026 Convictions of the said late Earle, and his adherents ...

On Mary’s accession to the throne he was made a privy councillor and master of the Court of Wards and Liveries. Throughout her Catholic reign, he sat in Parliament as one of the knights of the shire for Berkshire. But when Elizabeth was crowned, and the old religion was outlawed, Sir Francis fled from England. He lived in exile, at Vallodolid in Spain, for the remainder of his life. \n\nThe new monarch seized Englefield's lands and properties in 1589, granting them to Thomas Crompton, Robert Wright and Gelly Meyrick, acting as trustees for the Queen's favourite, Robert Devereux, the 2nd Earl of Essex, who was angling for Englefield House and for the money to refurbish it. This was part of his bid to win the hand of Sir Francis Walsingham's beautiful daughter, Frances, the widow of Sir Philip Sidney.\nEnglefield’s remaining property was sold by Crompton, Wright and Meyrick, also on Essex’s behalf, to raise money for the refurbishment of Englefield House. The present document records the sale of Englefield’s Berkshire lands. \n\nDated July 1st 1592, it relates that the entire village of Brimpton, its arable land, farms, church, and manor, have been sold to Thomas Johnson, merchant tailor, for a yearly sum of 19 pounds, 5 shillings and 3 pence. (That yearly payment is to be made on the Feast of the Annunciation – perhaps as a taunting reference to the Catholicism that lost Englefield his property.) \n\nThe transaction recorded in this document has not been previously known to historians of the manor and lands of Brimpton, who record only the later sale of the village, by the same three men, Crompton, Wright and Meyrick (on Essex’s behalf), to William Wollascott in 1595. What happened to Thomas Johnson and why his purchase was resold is unclear; perhaps, given Essex’s immediate needs, Wollascott was persuaded to provide more money for the same property.\n\nFollowing the Essex rebellion in February 1601, the authorities claimed that Meyrick was responsible for paying the players 40 shillings for reprising Richard II \"so old \u0026 so long out of use\" (TNA: PRO, SP 12/278/85) and he was imprisoned in Newgate. On 5 March he was tried at Westminster Hall and charged with rebellion on the grounds that he had fortified Essex House against the queen's forces, provided munitions for the earl's men, and helped to arrange the performance of the play. He made little effort to defend himself: \"I must die and not unwillingly; for the tree being fallen, the branches must not stand\" (State trials, 1.1449). Meyrick was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn on 13 March 1601.\n\nTranscription of manuscript indenture dated 1 July 1592 signed by Thomas Compton, Robert Wright, and Gelly Meyrick on behalf of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex.

In Shakespeare’s 1 Henry VI, Fastolfe is represented as a cowardly English captain who deserts Talbot, first at Patay, then again at Rouen.

He is author of Willobie his Avisa (1594), which contains an unattributed prefatory poem in which his celebration of Avisa's chastity is compared with that of ‘Shake-speare’ who ‘paints poore Lucrece rape’: this is the first ever printed reference to Shakespeare. As the book also contains a reference to taking counsel, when in love, with ‘his familiar friend W. S. who not long before had tryed the curtesy of the like passion, and was now newly recovered of the like infection’ (a man also described as an ‘old player’, well practised in the drama of a ‘loving Comedy … like to have growen to a Tragedy’), it is often suggested that Willoughby and Shakespeare knew one another. More dubious is the argument that maintains Willoughby is therefore Shakespeare's ‘W.H.’ and hence his fair youth. \n\nThe problem with all of the above has been that there is scant evidence to show Willoughby and Shakespeare ever met. The only person so far to uncover significant material potentially linking the men is Leslie Hotson in 1937; he found a mutual acquaintance, Thomas Russell, who could have introduced the two (L. Hotson, I, William Shakespeare (1937), 53–70). \n\nShakespeare is sometimes said to have performed with Pembroke’s men; he certainly had strong and continuous connections with the literary Earls of Pembroke. This document, by linking Pembroke and Willoughby (a link confirmed by Assize records showing the two present at sessions held in Winchester castle), provides a second conduit through which Willoughby could have been brought to Shakespeare.\n","binding":"","cost":0,"acquired":{"$date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"},"source":"","appraisalValue":1000,"titleTranscription":"","reference":"","__v":0,"tags":["Manuscripts"]},{"_id":{"$oid":"5c3fa9f98f86c30017a85fec"},"authors":["Herbert, William, 3rd Earl of Pembroke","Mohan, Sir Reginald"],"publishers":[],"printers":[],"editors":[],"owners":[],"ownersDescriptions":[],"files":[],"title":"Document","date":1616,"description":"Manuscript in ink, one page, 2º (305 x 200mm), some loss at right hand margin affecting the text; endorsed on verso. \n\nLetter signed (\"Penbrocke\") to Sir Reginald Mohan.\n\nPembroke had been Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall since 1604, and here he addresses his deputies about Pendennis Castle.

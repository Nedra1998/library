From Arthur Freeman: 
"Although in 1601 Sir Francis Bacon, aged forty, was an experienced and facile writer – of texts 
ranging from ‘devices’ or dramatic dialogues designed for private performance to legal opin-
ions, socio-political tracts, and the earlier of his immortalizing ‘essays or counsels civill and 
morall’ – A Declaration of the Practises and Treasons is only his second or third publication in 
print, following the brief initial selection of Essayes [and] Religious Meditations (1597) and the 
attributed Letter Written out of England to an English Gentleman Remaining at Padua (1599), 
on the pathetic and clumsy assassination conspiracy of Edward Squire. A Declaration, while 
quasi-official in its stance and auspices, proved controversial indeed, since throughout the 
previous decade Essex had been a close friend and patron of Bacon, forwarding his credit at 
court and (while he could) with the hitherto unsympathetic Queen. But on 8 February 1601 
– after his failure to suppress the campaign of the Irish rebels under Tyrone, and frustrated at 
his reduced political status – Essex led his own ‘forlorn’ rebellion against his sovereign: Bacon 
was compelled to choose between personal and national loyalty, and he turned state’s evidence 
with a vengeance, testifying and actively promoting the prosecution at the trial of Essex and 
his immediate followers, and at the Queen’s behest composing A Declaration, for which he 
received a reward of £1200, out of the sizeable fines levied on some of Bacon’s adherents. Essex 
himself, during the trial, accused Bacon of being ‘an accomplice’, by virtue of his having served 
at one time as his amanuensis, but Bacon successfully insisted he had ‘spent more time in vain 
in studying how to make the Earl a good servant to the Queen, than I have done in anything else’. Yet in 1604 he still felt uneasy enough to publish his Apologie in Certaine Imputations Concerning the late Earle of Essex, in which he somewhat petulantly defends himself further from charges of complicity and/or ingratitude.
 

Bacon’s own text (A3–K3) on Essex and the particulars of the abortive insurrection is 
followed (K4–Q4) by the ‘voluntary confessions’ of his fourteen supposed closest allies and 
five others, taken before and during the trial and concluding with two (dated 21 and 25 Feb-
ruary) by Essex himself, who was convicted and quickly executed in the Tower on the 25th. 
But for many readers the most provocative detail falls at the end of the first part (K2v–K3r), 
where Bacon gives a vivid account of a kind of ‘rally’ arranged by the would-be rebels on the 
eve of their fruitless march on the City. Sir Gelly Meyrick visited the Globe Theatre with a 
party of conspirators and negotiated with Augustine Phillips of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, 
Shakespeare’s own acting company, to perform the suggestive tragedy of Richard ii, ‘the Play 
of deposing King Richard the second’, on that Saturday, when members of Essex’s inner circle 
attended, hoping to inspire support from the citizenry for the next day’s campaign. The rel-
evant substance of Shakespeare’s play was of course the overthrow and subsequent death of 
a weak monarch, ousted by the vigorous usurper Henry iv (Bolingbroke), and the voluntary 
abdication of the former – in a famous scene (iv.i.154–315) played onstage as early as 1597, but 
withheld from print until the fourth quarto of 1608. Phillips objected, like the company man he 
was, that ‘the Play was olde, and they should have losse in playing it, because fewe would come 
to it’, but was appeased by a promised subsidy of ‘fourty shillings extraordinarie given to play 
it, and so thereupon playd it was’. ‘Neither was it casuall’, Bacon adds, ‘but a Play bespoken by 
Merrick’, although Phillips later alleged that the applicants were Sir Charles Percy, Sir Jocelyn 
Percy, and Lord Mounteagle, ‘with some thre[e] more’ (Shakspere Allusion-Book (1932), i:82, 
oddly omitting Bacon’s text)."

# Document
## Devereux, Robert 

**Title:**  Document

**Authors:**  Devereux, Robert 

**Title Transcription:**  

**Printers:**  

**Date:**  1592

**Reference:**  

**Binding:**  

**Description:**  Document, 1p, on vellum with 4 wax seals.

Recently-discovered document by which Queen Elizabeth transferred the confiscated lands and property of Sir Francis Englefield to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex.

Signed by Gelly Meyrick, later executed for commissioning Shakespeare's acting company to perform Richard II on the eve of the Essex Rebellion in 1601.

Sir Francis Englefield (1522-1605), one of the chief officers of the household of Princess Mary, was a devout Catholic. On Mary’s accession to the throne he was made a privy councillor and master of the Court of Wards and Liveries. Throughout her Catholic reign, he sat in Parliament as one of the knights of the shire for Berkshire. But when Elizabeth was crowned, and the old religion was outlawed, Sir Francis fled from England. He lived in exile, at Vallodolid in Spain, for the remainder of his life. 

The new monarch seized Englefield's lands and properties in 1589, granting them to Thomas Crompton, Robert Wright and Gelly Meyrick, acting as trustees for the Queen's favourite, Robert Devereux, the 2nd Earl of Essex, who was angling for Englefield House and for the money to refurbish it. This was part of his bid to win the hand of Sir Francis Walsingham's beautiful daughter, Frances, the widow of Sir Philip Sidney.
Englefield’s remaining property was sold by Crompton, Wright and Meyrick, also on Essex’s behalf, to raise money for the refurbishment of Englefield House. The present document records the sale of Englefield’s Berkshire lands. 

Dated July 1st 1592, it relates that the entire village of Brimpton, its arable land, farms, church, and manor, have been sold to Thomas Johnson, merchant tailor, for a yearly sum of 19 pounds, 5 shillings and 3 pence. (That yearly payment is to be made on the Feast of the Annunciation – perhaps as a taunting reference to the Catholicism that lost Englefield his property.) 

The transaction recorded in this document has not been previously known to historians of the manor and lands of Brimpton, who record only the later sale of the village, by the same three men, Crompton, Wright and Meyrick (on Essex’s behalf), to William Wollascott in 1595. What happened to Thomas Johnson and why his purchase was resold is unclear; perhaps, given Essex’s immediate needs, Wollascott was persuaded to provide more money for the same property.

Following the Essex rebellion in February 1601, the authorities claimed that Meyrick was responsible for paying the players 40 shillings for reprising Richard II "so old & so long out of use" (TNA: PRO, SP 12/278/85) and he was imprisoned in Newgate. On 5 March he was tried at Westminster Hall and charged with rebellion on the grounds that he had fortified Essex House against the queen's forces, provided munitions for the earl's men, and helped to arrange the performance of the play. He made little effort to defend himself: "I must die and not unwillingly; for the tree being fallen, the branches must not stand" (State trials, 1.1449). Meyrick was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn on 13 March 1601.

Transcription of manuscript indenture dated 1 July 1592 signed by Thomas Compton, Robert Wright, and Gelly Meyrick on behalf of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex.

Richard Brinsley Sheridan's (1751-1816) copy of the fourth edition of Tom Jones. In 1778 Sheridan and David Garrick brought Fielding's lost play The Fathers: or, the Good-Natur'd Man to Drury Lane for the benefit of Fielding's widow. A manuscript fragment of the play had been found among the papers of Sir Charles Hanbury Williams and identified as Fielding's by Garrick. It ran for nine nights, the house packed with Fielding's friends, and brought his widow Mary much needed relief.

The Coronation is a Caroline era stage play, a tragicomedy written by James Shirley, and notable for the tug-of-war of authorship claims in which it was involved in the middle seventeenth century. The first edition of The Coronation was issued in 1640 in a quarto printed by Thomas Cotes for the booksellers Andrew Crooke and William Cooke. And the authorship of the play was assigned to John Fletcher.

# Document 
## Herbert, Henry, 2nd Earl Pembroke

**Title:**  Document 

**Authors:**  Herbert, Henry, 2nd Earl Pembroke

**Title Transcription:**  

**Printers:**  

**Date:**  1598

**Reference:**  

**Binding:**  

**Description:**  Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl Pembroke (1534-1601), patron of the Pembroke's Men, possibly Shakespeare's acting company before he and others joined the Chamberlain's Men in 1594.  

This document is signed by four of the successive High Sheriffs of Wiltshire and probably dates to the late 1590s ("1598" is written in the upper left in pencil in a later hand).

High Sheriffs of Wiltshire from 1588-98 (signatories of the present document in bold):

1588: Henry Willoughby, of Knoyle Odierne or West Knoyle
1589: John Warneford, of Sevenhampton near Highworth
1590: William Eyre, of Great Chalfield
1591: Sir John Hungerford
1592: Sir John Thynne
1593: John Hungerford, of Stoke near Great Bedwyn
1594: Sir Henry Sadler Kt, of Everley
1595: John Dauntsey, of West Lavington
1596: Sir James Mervyn Kt., of Fonthil
1597: Sir Edward Penruddocke, of Compton Chamberlayn
1598: Walter Vaughan, of Falstone

Henry Willoughby is the most famous of these sheriffs. He is author of Willobie his Avisa (1594), which contains an unattributed prefatory poem in which his celebration of Avisa's chastity is compared with that of ‘Shake-speare’ who ‘paints poore Lucrece rape’: this is the first ever printed reference to Shakespeare. As the book also contains a reference to taking counsel, when in love, with ‘his familiar friend W. S. who not long before had tryed the curtesy of the like passion, and was now newly recovered of the like infection’ (a man also described as an ‘old player’, well practised in the drama of a ‘loving Comedy … like to have growen to a Tragedy’), it is often suggested that Willoughby and Shakespeare knew one another. More dubious is the argument that maintains Willoughby is therefore Shakespeare's ‘W.H.’ and hence his fair youth. 

The problem with all of the above has been that there is scant evidence to show Willoughby and Shakespeare ever met. The only person so far to uncover significant material potentially linking the men is Leslie Hotson in 1937; he found a mutual acquaintance, Thomas Russell, who could have introduced the two (L. Hotson, I, William Shakespeare (1937), 53–70). 

Shakespeare is sometimes said to have performed with Pembroke’s men; he certainly had strong and continuous connections with the literary Earls of Pembroke. This document, by linking Pembroke and Willoughby (a link confirmed by Assize records showing the two present at sessions held in Winchester castle), provides a second conduit through which Willoughby could have been brought to Shakespeare.

**Description:**  Manuscript in ink, one page, 2º (305 x 200mm), some loss at right hand margin affecting the text; endorsed on verso. 

Letter signed ("Penbrocke") to Sir Reginald Mohan.

Pembroke had been Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall since 1604, and here he addresses his deputies about Pendennis Castle. Among his correspondents is Richard Carew - almost certainly the antiquary Richard Carew of Antony (1555-1620), author of the Survey of Cornwall. 

After my very hartye commendaconns, whearas at the Laste musters 
thear was a question stirred by Sir John Parker his depytye of 
the castle of Pendennis, whether the ffyve parishes allotted heretofore 
to that castle, should bee mustred by yow, and viewed and trained b<y> 
the muster master, which though now it bee derided, so as I shall no<t> 
expect to hear of the like agayne, but that they are as ffree for <yow> 
to enrol, impose armes, muster and trayne, as any other part of the <> 
Sheere. yet Least that it maye on the other side bee thought, that they
are thearby cleerlye exempted from the castle, I have thought f<it to> 
let yow knowe, That when yow and the Serjant major and mu<ster> 
master have don that in those parishes which beelongeth to yor p<> 
that then yow doo delyver to the captayne of the sayd castle or h<is> 
deputye the Roll of the names of all the Soldiors thear to the end 
that hee maye knowe what numbers they are, and that theye  <may> 
Likewise bee subject to the Alarm of the castle, and to such othe<r> 
services as heretofore they have bene accustomed to doo. And yf <the> 
captayne shall have a desire to muster them at any tyme bee<fore> 
the generall musters, I am contented that hee shall doo it, So as 
it bee in the presence of some of yow, And that it bee at his owne

Early manuscript criticism of Poetaster by Thomas North on verso of frontis: 

                            upon ye excellent comœdy named poetaster
	                    by ye Author, mr B: Johnson.

How easy is it for to write in Rime

And to observe ye Numbers, and ye time

wth ye proportion of a fluent verse!

How easy too, such writings to reherse!

But to give weight to words: to Numbers, wit;

To sliding Language sence to’enamel it,

Is yt wch doth a poets Image frame,

And doth reiect a poёtasters Name.

Thy comœdy in title dammes ye last,

But ye deserts farre of ye first hath past.

And whilst it gently lashes fluide wits

And frothy pens, from ye best praises getts.

How happy then art thou, whose learned streame

shines much more lustrous, by thire watry veine,

who by decyphering a poetasters fault,

do’st ye pernasian mount win and assault!

Let then hereafter, those wch meane to see

themselves good poets, poёtasters bee.

And know, yt if they honour true would haue

The first step to it, is not to write graue,

And serious things alone: but so to dresse

Their lines, yt great wits may meane things expresse

In such a sort, that glory may from those

grow to aheighth, and they thire meanenesse lose.

Smal and weake wits, can praise praiseworthy things;

But great wits only to meane, honour brings.

Then poёtasters, leaue your dabling trade

of libells, satyres, epigrammes il made,

And flattere not your sterued muse, because

she tumbles al shee thinks, sans any pause,

But study hard, and learne; youre matter found

your verse wil follow in a Cadence round.

And wth ye helpe of art, you then may see

your fonts adorned, wth Apolloes tree.

**Description:**  An example of Mercator's map of the World, based upon the writings of Claudius Ptolemy, from a later edition of Gerard Mercator's <i>Tabulae geographicae CI. Ptolemaei ad mentem autoris restitutae et emendatae per G. Mercatorem</i>. 

This is the revised second state of Mercator's 1578 Ptolemaic world map. The border has been re-engraved, and now includes a frieze of allegorical figures representing the four elements of Fire (Zeus), Air (Hera), Water (Neptune), and Earth (Gaia), rather than the strapwork and windhead border of the earlier editions.

The map includes a massive Taprobana (modern day Sri Lanka) in the Indian Ocean. The Indian subcontinent is severely truncated and the Indian Ocean appears to be land locked. Only the northern part of Africa is shown with the Nile originating in the twin lakes south of the Equator in the Lunae montes (Mountains of the Moon).

The atlas, first published in 1578, included Ptolemy's twenty-seven maps, carefully restored, handsomely engraved, and supplemented by an index of place names and an enlarged boundary map of the Nile Delta.

die in charity with all men. I think my butchered body will I4 Nov.
be taken care of and buried as a Christian, by order of Francis

good deal of money to and for me, whereof you may expect a
particular account, which I leave you on my blessing to repay
him. I die with the greatest regret that I've been a bad
husband to you, and I beg you'll pardon me in your heart,
and that you 11 express your goodness (as you'll answer to God
and me in the everlasting world) by your care of and motherly fol. 426.
looking to your children's salvation and right putting them
to business in this world. I know not how many are alive;
only set the boys to some right imployment while young, and
strive to admonish the daughters in the fear of God. I herewith
send you a note of what I would have done with the trifles
I have a concern in, for you know the lump of my business.
My dearest,—If I should write till my life ends I would still
have something to say. But to stop that I end with my dying
blessing to you, my young ones, and your poor mother, if
alive. Your last from, your unfortunate husband,

having been captured at his own house, when, after lurking long among the
neighbouring hills, he ventured to pass a night there. His captors, not being
sure of his identity, carried him before the minister of the parish, but not getting
satisfaction from him, they took him to a farmhouse where his wife and children
resided. On his approach his children ran out and greeted him with cries of
' Daddy ! Daddy !' and so unwittingly sealed their father's fate. He was tried
at Carlisle and executed there on I5th November I746. As the prisoners taken
at Carlisle were sent to London, and those taken in Scotland to Carlisle, the
story may be authentic."

**Binding:**  

**Description:**  Manuscript in ink. 2º (305 x 200mm). One page.

Some loss at right hand margin affecting the text, but much of the text still intact; endorsed on verso.

A fine letter from Pembroke to the deputy lieutenants of Cornwall: Pembroke had been Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall since 1604, and here he addresses his deputies about Pendennis Castle (near Falmouth). Among his correspondents is Richard Carew - almost certainly the antiquary Richard Carew of Antony (1555-1620), author of the Survey of Cornwall, or his son Sir Richard (1680-1643). Pembroke is well known as a candidate for the dedicatee of Shakespeare s Sonnets (1609); he was of course also the co-dedicatee of the First Folio, and clearly knew and patronised Shakespeare. This document is signed less than three months after Shakespeare s death, which occurred on 23 April 1616.

**Description:**  One page autograph manuscript. A page handwritten by Sand from the play "Comme Il Vous Plaria", her translation of William Shakespeare's play, "As You Like It". The play was performed at the Comédie-Française in 1856, and the manuscript may date from that time. The page is an excerpt of a conversation between Jacques and Celia in act II, scene VII. Sand made several changes to Shakespeare's work, most notably her creation of a romantic connection between Celia and Jacques rather than adhering to the original Celia and Oliver pairing. In her preface, Sand remarks that the changes she made were in an attempt to fit the fashion of the time. Lightly toned, darker around edges and at mail folds. Light foxing, some ink transfer.

# The Visitation
## The Fastolfe Master

**Title:**  The Visitation

**Authors:**  The Fastolfe Master

**Title Transcription:**  

**Printers:**  

**Date:**  1450

**Reference:**  

**Binding:**  

**Description:**  Arched illuminated miniature on vellum of the Visitation (101 x 69 mm), with full illuminated border. Northern France (Rouen), c. 1450.

Size of leaf: 180 x 133 mm. On verso, small illuminated initials and 3 lines of gothic text.

A fine miniature from one of the centers of illumination in the 15th century, painted by the Fastolfe Master; this artist trained with the Bedford Master in the early part of the 15th century and then worked in Rouen in the second quarter of the century. He takes his name from a manuscript of Christian de Pisan produced in Rouen for Sir John Falstolfe, and may have moved to England with him in the mid-15th century. The starry sky and windmill at the top of the miniature is a characteristic feature of the Falstolfe Master, as are layered cliffs.

<i>Mary and Elizabeth stand clasping each other, set on a rocky landscape; in the upper background are a windmill and a starry sky; the miniature enclosed within three-sided border of decorative colored flowers and leaves on wide burnished gold ground, large initial infilled with blue and orange flowers on curly stems on a burnished gold ground, outer borders of colored acanthus and other flowers, and small gold leaves on hair-line stems.</i>


### Owners:
* **Falstolfe, Sir John:**   (c.1378-1459). Fastolfe fought under Henry V in the French campaign, and after the capture of Harfleur in 1415 was made governor of the city. In 1429 he successfully brought provisions to the English army besieging Orleans. While serving under John Talbot, Fastolfe was put to flight at Patay by Joan of Arc. In Shakespeare’s 1 Henry VI, Fastolfe is represented as a cowardly English captain who deserts Talbot, first at Patay, then again at Rouen. For his faint-heartedness he is deprived of the Garter and banished. It is generally assumed that Shakespeare derived the name Falstaff from Fastolfe.
